# foxrollbot

This is a dice-rolling bot for Telegram. To use it,
[send it a message](https://telegram.me/foxrollbot). It'll tell you everything
you need to know.

It's MIT-licensed, and requires
[python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/). I've only tested it
with Python 3.5.1, but I'm sure it would work with any other releases of Python
3, and it may even work with Python 2.
