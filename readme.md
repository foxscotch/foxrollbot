# foxrollbot

This is a dice-rolling bot for Telegram. To use it, [send it a message][bot].
It'll tell you everything you need to know.

After just over two years of inactivity, I've taken to reviving it a bit.
First, I intend to just refactor code, and then I plan to add a few features,
such as statistics and saved rolls.

It's MIT-licensed, and requires [python-telegram-bot][ptb] 13.1. It should
work with Python 3.6+.
