As mentioned in the /start message, the bot's made by @foxscotch.
The bot's open source, as are most things I make, and you can see that source [on GitHub](https://github.com/foxscotch/foxrollbot). If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message directly. I'll be happy to answer them if I can. And if you find any bugs, either send me a message on Telegram, or open an issue on GitHub.
